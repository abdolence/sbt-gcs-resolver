# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please follow general guidelines defined here:
https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Vulnerability_Disclosure_Cheat_Sheet.html

## Security considerations and risks

### OSS
Open source code is created through voluntary collaboration of software developers.
The original authors license the code so that anyone can see it, modify it, and
distribute new versions of it.
You should manage all OSS using the same procedures and tools that you use for
commercial products. As always, train your employees on
cyber security best practices that can help them securely
use and manage software products.
